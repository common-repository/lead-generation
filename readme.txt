ActiveConvert helps you build great looking optin forms in just minutes.  You can choose from 8 default templates including:  collect email, call to action, yes/no question, coupon offer, social sharing, and feedback.  Each optin form gives you the option to display it as a popup modal, a full screen interstitial, or welcome bar, a footer bar, or a slide-in form.

All of the templates are responsive and look great on mobile.

= ActiveConvert Drip Email Sequences =

Once you collect a new subscriber using one of our forms, the next step is to either add them to your third party email list provider like MailChimp, or Campaign Monitor.  

Unlike other platforms, we also provide drip email sequences that you can trigger from your popups and send right from your Google or G-Suite account.  Create a series of emails to nuture leads, send a welcome sequence, or send an upgrade sequences to upgrade free trial users.  Our drip sequences support send delays, tag matching, and advanced features to allow simplicity and flexibilty in your sales funnels.
